# Terraform Configuration Documentation

## Project Description

This Terraform project manages AWS EC2 instances with different configurations. It uses variables to define the AMI and instance type, and it captures the public IP address as an output.

Input Variables
---------------

This module supports the following input variables:

* `ami` (Required): The ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to use for the EC2 instance. You should specify an AMI ID, e.g., `"ami-0123456789abcdef0"`.

* `instance_type` (Required): The type of the EC2 instance, e.g., `"t2.micro"`. You can choose the instance type that suits your application needs

Outputs
-------

This module defines the following output variable:

* `public_ip`: The public IP address of the created EC2 instance.

You can access the public IP address in your Terraform code by referencing `module.techlearnings_aws_ec2.public_ip`.
